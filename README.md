Vampire Overlay
=====================

My personal overlay. Mostly contains live ebuilds of console applications that aren't in the tree or are outdated there. Also an occasional changed ebuild to turn on bleeding-edge options.

So much bleeding edge here, you would bet a vampire was involved.

Notable changed ebuilds:
-----------------------
- **Goldendict** - builds it from Qt5 branch and adds a ton of translations as USE flags.
